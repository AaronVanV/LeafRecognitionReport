# Leaf Recognition

Welcome to our Leaf Recognition project.

In this report you can find explanations of the code, how to use it and extra information about the project.

The link to the code: [LeafRecognitionCode](https://github.com/AaronVanV/LeafRecognitionCode)

## Abstract

Wouldn't it be great to know with species of tree a certain leaf belongs to?
We were able to create a project that recognize 15 tree species by its leaves. This is realized by first processing the images of the leaves from a Swedish dataset using Matlab, then putting those processed images through a python Keras training model which trains to recognize the 15 Swedish tree species. Then you can take a new picture of a leaf in those 15 species, run it through the image processing Matlab code and let the prediction code run on that processed image. It will return a prediction of the species of the inputted image with a percentage of how certain the model is. Some expansions on the project would be to increase the amount of tree species and some automation of the Matlab image processor, so you the prediction would run in 1 smooth motion.

## About us

We are third year students in Electronics-IT at Vives Bruges, this is the report of our project for the subject Deep Learning.
We got the assignment make a project that uses deep learning and preferably Matlab.
