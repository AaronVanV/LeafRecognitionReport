# Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a program that can help nature enthusiasts identify tree species from photographs of their leaves.

A useful sub-goal would be to deploy the project in such a way that it can easily be used in an outdoor environment. It could for instance be deployed as a mobile app. In addition to that, the app could provide some useful information about the tree species in question.
