# Conclusion

We largely succeeded in achieving our goal of creating a neural network that can recognize different types of leaves. While the algorithm works and the processing of the images also works there are still some problems we didn't solve.

Now the model can only see 15 different leaf's in practice this is not nearly enough to be able to be used practically, another problem is that the 90% accuracy is of images of the dataset, if you would take a picture yourself and run it through the model it would not nearly be this accurate due to, different color gradients, camera angle, amount of light when the picture is taken and the list goes on.
We also were not able to make a user friendly app to scan leaf's and run them through our model.

All in all I would say this project was a success, in the limited time span we were able to create a working model with an accuracy of 90%+ from a dataset we had some doubts about at the start.
