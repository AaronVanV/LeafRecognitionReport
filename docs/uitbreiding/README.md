# Possible Expansions

There are still a lot of missing features that are vital to this program in order to be useful.

## Dataset

To start off, the AI-model needs to be able to identify a lot more different tree species. Currently the dataset only contains tree species found in Sweden. This dataset could be expanded to contain species from all over the world. It would also be nice if it could identify plants other than trees, like crops, bushes and maybe even fungi.

## Deployment

The application also needs to be deployed on mobile devices so that users can use it while they are outdoors. The app should allow them to take a picture and give them an immediate result, along with some information about the species they just discovered. The app could also come with other features that would please the user, for example a map where they would see all the species they discovered with the exact location of where they found them.

## Accuracy

Finally, to improve the accuracy it would be nice if the neural network could adapt if a user spotted a wrong prediction. This means that the neural network isn't restricted to the pre-existing dataset anymore. Instead, it could also learn with the images that are taken by the users.
