# Description of the problem

Throughout the year we see trees growing, changing color and shape. Wouldn't it be great to know which tree you're looking at?
Nobody has the time to look through a book or website which shows a list of al the trees with its leaves. This project could help you identify which tree a certain leaf comes from.

This project is for everyone, but you do need a bit of technological knowledge.

This project shows you how you can process images using Matlab, train a deep learning model using Keras on python and make predictions using that model with new images. Which is great for beginners who want to learn deep learning using Keras.
